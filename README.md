## About Me
I'm a dedicated developer with over 7 years of experience in IT, combining a strong technical foundation with solid management skills. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work across various industries, including real estate and legal-tech, where I took on project management roles and helped drive technology initiatives from concept to execution.

Currently, I'm focused on digital marketing and big data, leading projects that merge technical innovation with business impact. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, always aiming to create adaptable, scalable solutions that prioritize product value as much as technical excellence.
